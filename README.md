## Change Log

 * 0.2.4 Added convert_to_monotonic function
 * 0.2.3 Fixed issue with syllabification, where iota with diaeresis is not an independent vowel (roloiou), also fixed a secondary issue with accentuation, where previously redundant diaeresis was not removed in above cases.
 * 0.2.2 Fixed issue with internal augmentation with unaccented augment, now it gives such an option
 * 0.2.1 Added transcription module (simple, Erasmian and modern for Polish readers)
 * 0.1.1 Initial release
