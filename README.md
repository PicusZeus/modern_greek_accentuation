## Change Log
 * 0.522 Added exclusion flag to convert_to_monotonic (one_sylleble_rule)
 * 0.511 Improvement in code structure
 * 0.2.6 Fixed issue with converting to monotonic function, when it would strip word also from dieresis
 * 0.2.5 Small improvements to augmentify module, now it deals correctly with accented prefixes when creating augmented stems
 * 0.2.4 Added convert_to_monotonic function

 * 0.2.1 Added transcription module (simple, Erasmian and modern for Polish readers)
